# Project 2 - *NYTimesSearch*

**NYTimesSearch** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **28** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ **DONE**] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.

* [**DONE**] Subsequent searches have any filters applied to the search results
* [**DONE**] User can tap on any article in results to view the contents in an embedded browser.
* [**DONE**] User can **scroll down to see more articles**. The maximum number of articles is limited by the API search.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [**DONE**] Implements robust error handling, [check if internet is available](Checked for Network)(http://guides.codepath.com/android/Sending-and-Managing-Network-Requests#checking-for-network-connectivity), handle error cases, network failures
* [**DONE**] Used the **ActionBar SearchView** or custom layout as the query box instead of an EditText
* [**DONE**] User can **share an article link** to their friends or email it to themselves
* [ **DONE**] Replaced Filter Settings Activity with a lightweight modal overlay
* [**DONE**] Improved the user interface and experiment with image assets and/or styling and coloring

The following **bonus** features are implemented:

* [ **DONE**] Use the [RecyclerView](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-the-RecyclerView) with the `StaggeredGridLayoutManager` to display improve the grid of image results
* [ **DONE**] Replace all icon drawables and other static image assets with [vector drawables](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Drawables#vector-drawables) where appropriate.
* [ **DONE**] Replace Picasso with [Glide](http://inthecheesefactory.com/blog/get-to-know-glide-recommended-by-google/en) for more efficient image rendering.
* [ ] Uses [retrolambda expressions](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Lambda-Expressions) to cleanup event handling blocks.
* [**DONE** ] Leverages the popular [GSON library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Android-Async-Http-Client#decoding-with-gson-library) to streamline the parsing of JSON data.
* [ **DONE**] Leverages the [Retrofit networking library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Consuming-APIs-with-Retrofit) to access the New York Times API.
* [ ] For different news articles that only have text or only have images, use [Heterogenous Layouts](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Heterogenous-Layouts-inside-RecyclerView) with RecyclerView
* [ ] Use Parcelable instead of Serializable using the popular [Parceler library](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-Parceler).
* [ ] Leverages the [data binding support module](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Applying-Data-Binding-for-Views) to bind data into layout templates.
